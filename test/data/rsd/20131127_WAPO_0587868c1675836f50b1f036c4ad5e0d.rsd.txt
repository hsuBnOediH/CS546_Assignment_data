Are hydrogen cars the wave of the future? Toyota thinks so.

The current conventional wisdom is that plug-in electric vehicles will be the clean, sleek cars of tomorrow. Think of Tesla's Model S or Chevrolet's Volt. These cars get most of the media attention, and policymakers tend to toss tax breaks their way.
Not all automakers, however, are persuaded that plug-ins are the only way to go. This month, Honda, Toyota and Hyundai all announced plans to produce hydrogen fuel-cell passenger vehicles in the next few years. These cars will run on compressed hydrogen — and emit only water vapor as exhaust.
For a long time, hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles were seen as a tantalizing technology to help reduce society's dependency on oil. In theory, fuel-cell vehicles could charge in minutes and go for hundreds of miles before refueling — overcoming the disadvantages of plug-in electric cars with their bulky batteries and limited ranges.
But the vehicles themselves were seen as forbiddingly expensive, and the challenges in setting up a hydrogen fueling infrastructure looked insurmountable. That explains why hydrogen lost its allure in the 2000s, particularly as batteries improved and electric vehicles became a reality. In 2009, the U.S. Department of Energy shifted its research and funding away from hydrogen and toward battery-driven electric cars.
Now the pendulum may be swinging back. Plug-in electric cars aren't selling quite as well as their advocates once hoped. And the cost of hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles seems to be dropping. Could hydrogen be in for a comeback? Or are the obstacles still too steep?
Toyota's fuel-cell plans
Toyota's emphasis on hydrogen is especially noteworthy. Sixteen years ago, the Japanese automaker was the first company to produce a commercially successful hybrid-electric car — the Prius, which features both a gasoline engine and an electric motor whose battery is charged by braking energy. That success led to a rising interest in electric cars.
Yet unlike many companies, Toyota isn't focused on all-electric vehicle as the logical next step. "The reason why Toyota doesn’t introduce any major [all-electric vehicles] is because we do not believe there is a market to accept it,” said Toyota Chairman Takeshi Uchiyamada during a speech in Washington D.C. back in September.
Uchiyamada argued that battery technology still needs a few major breakthroughs before all-electric vehicles can compete with hybrids or traditional gasoline-powered cars — the batteries are expensive, have limited range, and take hours to recharge fully. So, for now, Toyota will focus on improving its line of hybrids to meet rising fuel-economy standards in the United States.
But the company is also betting on hydrogen. Toyota is promising a mass-produced fuel-cell vehicle in Japan by 2015 and one in the United States by 2016. The price? Between $50,000 and $100,000. That lower end is comparable to the cost of Toyota's Lexus sedans, and it's cheap enough that hydrogen vehicles could possibly have mass appeal — particularly if gasoline prices ever start rising again.
Other automakers agree that fuel-cell vehicle costs are falling dramatically. "These things are now ready for prime time,” John Krafcik, Hyundai's North American CEO, recently told the Associated Press. But is that enough to edge out plug-ins?
Fuel cells vs. plug-in vehicles
Let's start with a rough breakdown of the two technologies: Plug-in electric vehicles are powered by batteries that are charged through outlets. Hydrogen fuel cells, by contrast, use a chemical process to separate out the electrons in molecules of hydrogen gas that, in turn, power the car's electric motor.
The main advantages of hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles: They can charge within minutes and have a longer range than plug-ins. Toyota estimates that its fuel-cell cars will travel 375 miles before refueling. That's a huge deal. Right now, some analysts think plug-in vehicles are being held back by the fact that they take awhile to charge and have limited range.
