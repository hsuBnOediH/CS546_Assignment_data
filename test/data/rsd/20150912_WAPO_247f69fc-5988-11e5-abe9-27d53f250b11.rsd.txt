NEW DELHI — At least 89 people were killed at a restaurant in central India on Saturday when a cooking gas cylinder exploded and triggered a second blast of explosive detonators stored illegally nearby, police said.
The restaurant, located next to the main bus station in the town of Petlawad in Madhya Pradesh state, was crowded with people having breakfast when the blasts occurred.
The building where the restaurant was located and an adjacent building were destroyed in the explosions, said Mewa Lal Gond, a police inspector in the mining district of Jhabua, where Petlawad is located.
“After the initial explosion, many people came to see what had happened. Witnesses said the subsequent blast claimed more lives,” Gond said.
Most of those killed in the explosions were poor laborers. About 100 other people were injured in the blasts and were taken to hospitals, Gond said.
Police struggled to keep hundreds of onlookers and people looking for relatives away from the site of the explosions, he said. The crowds hampered the movement of ambulances and other emergency vehicles, and officers had to push them back to allow a bulldozer to reach the restaurant.
Police said rescue teams had completed the search for survivors and recovered all the bodies from the blast.
Local police officer Kamlesh Bamaniya said a local contractor had been given a license to purchase detonators for his business of digging wells but had stored the detonators illegally in a room adjacent to the restaurant. The contractor was killed in the blasts and several of his family members were missing, Bamaniya said.
Residents were evacuated from several adjoining buildings that were damaged in the blasts, said a police officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media.
Petlawad, in the mining district of Jhabua, is about 185 miles from the state capital, Bhopal.
