NTSB releases preliminary report in Amtrak derailment

Investigators looking into last month’s deadly Amtrak derailment have found “no anomalies” in the tracks, signals, braking systems or the locomotive pulling train #188, according to a preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board released Tuesday, underscoring the key outstanding question of their ongoing inquiry: Why did the locomotive speed into a sharp Philadelphia curve at 106 miles an hour?
The NTSB said it is continuing its examination of engineer Brandon Bostian’s cell phone records. Bostian, who said he cannot recall the events shortly before the crash, reported to the NTSB that his phone was in a bag at the time of the derailment.
“Investigators are in the process of correlating the time stamps in the engineer’s cell phone records with multiple data sources including the locomotive event recorder, the locomotive outward facing video, recorded radio communications, and surveillance video,” the NTSB said Tuesday.
The text message and voice logs have time stamps from different time zones, and there are technical inconsistencies, the NTSB says, accounting for the delays in coming up with a clear timeline to determine if the phone was in use while the Bostian was operating the train. Bostian has cooperated with the inquiry, including providing his cell phone password, according to the NTSB.
Eight people were killed and 200 were taken to hospitals following the accident that occurred on a night with 82-degree weather, a gentle 20 mph breeze, “clear skies and good visibility,” according the NTSB. Bostian had increased the train’s speed sharply after passing at low speeds through the North Philadelphia station.
According to a review of the train’s data recorder, “the train was traveling at 106 mph before the emergency brake system engaged…The engineer activated the emergency brakes seconds before the derailment.”
The speed limit heading north before reaching the curve at Frankford Junction is 80 mph, with a 50 mph limit for the curve itself. Amtrak said Tuesday that the “turnover speed” at that corner is 98 mph. An automatic braking system had been installed on the southbound tracks at Frankford Junction after a major Boston derailment in 1990, but not on the northbound tracks. Amtrak says that is because the top approach speed headed south is 110 mph, higher than the turnover speed.
The system would, if installed northbound, have been able to stop the train if Bostian did not slow down in time, rail experts said.
A separate, more advanced speed-control system is set to be activated along that section and the rest of the northeast corridor by a year-end congressional deadline, Amtrak said.
Such “positive train control” systems were mandated in 2008, following a deadly California accident, but most major railroads are far from completing the system. The NTSB is also investigating the crash worthiness of the Amtrak railcars, including looking at how the passenger railroad’s cars stack up against those in other countries, NTSB chairman Christopher A. Hart told the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure during an oversight hearing Tuesday.
Amtrak estimated that the monetary value of the damage due to the derailment topped $9.2 million, according to the NTSB.
