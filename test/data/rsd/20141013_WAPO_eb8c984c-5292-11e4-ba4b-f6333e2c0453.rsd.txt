Hong Kong protesters rebuild barricades after scuffles; police warn of more action

HONG KONG — Pro-democracy protesters erected even stronger fortifications around their sprawling encampment in Hong Kong’s business district Monday, after an abortive attack on their sit-in by masked men led to scuffles and heightened tensions.
The day had begun with police peacefully removing barriers around the periphery of the main protest site at dawn, in what they said was an attempt to ease traffic congestion but not to clear the demonstrators. It ended with protesting students dramatically reinforcing their defenses and police warning that they would be back.
The developments increasingly suggest that the standoff is entering a decisive phase: The chance of police action to clear the protest site appears to be growing by the day, but the challenge they would face also is steadily mounting.
Tensions peaked about midday Monday as hundreds of people converged on the site demanding that the roads be reopened.
As the opponents chanted slogans against the sit-in, groups of men, many wearing surgical masks, rushed the barricades at both ends of Queensway, a wide street that runs through Admiralty district.
At one end, they used knives to cut the plastic cable ties securing the barricades and removed them in two trucks. Some pushed and punched students who tried to hold on to the barriers.
But at the other end, pro-democracy protesters quickly regrouped, forming human chains across the street and sitting behind barricades, facing a line of police keeping the two sides apart.
“Open the roads,” chanted dozens of people unhappy with the sit-in, accusing the students of being tools of the West and not “real Chinese.”
“Don’t let them pass,” the pro-democracy demonstrators replied, accusing their opponents of not being Hong Kong natives. “Go back to the mainland,” they chanted. “Speak Cantonese.”
The protests have reflected growing tensions between Hong Kong natives and Chinese mainlanders, who have flooded into the territory since its handover from British rule in 1997.
Scores of taxi drivers drove up to signal their opposition to the protesters, honking horns. “You are breaking our rice bowl,” read one slogan pasted on a car, referring to a loss of income.
Gradually, however, the group opposed to the protests dispersed, and students began reinforcing the barricades at almost every intersection, using hundreds of bamboo poles, wooden boards and anything else they could get their hands on.
Queensway lies to the south of the main protest site, and the barricades there had been lightly manned for days. But Monday they were filled with people, activity and the sound of hammering.
“I feel sorry for the young people,” said an old man nailing wooden boards together who said his name was Chan. “You can never trust the Communist Party.”
The government once again urged protesters to end what it deems their illegal occupation of the streets, while police called the move to reinforce the barricades “illegal and extremely irresponsible.”
Senior police spokesman Hui Chun-tak said they would soon be back to remove the barriers, “so as to recover part of the roads for public transport and tram services, but not to clear the protesters.”
Indeed, early Tuesday morning, about 250 officers cleared away more barriers at a second protest site in the Causeway Bay shopping district, witnesses said, some forming a human chain around protesters while others removed barricades. Several roads were reopened to traffic, shrinking the protest area but not removing the protesters.
The authorities have swung between intransigence and seeming indifference to the protests, interspersed with half-hearted and sometimes heavy-handed attempts to take on the students.
Almost every move the authorities have made has only galvanized the protests further, and it was no different Monday.
