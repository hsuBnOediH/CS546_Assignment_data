As Hispanic population booms, immigration debate comes to key Republican’s Va. district

ROANOKE — As chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, a panel at the center of the national immigration debate, Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) has taken a tough stance on illegal immigration that reflects the views of many House Republicans: better border security and law enforcement before other reforms, and “zero tolerance” for illegal immigrants in the future.
But as the representative of the sprawling 6th Congressional District in southwest Virginia, the former immigration lawyer faces the sort of changing demographics that have transformed this conservative, rural region into a multinational mosaic — and that have put immigration reform at the top of the national agenda.
Roanoke, Goodlatte’s home in the Blue Ridge Valley, has seen its Hispanic population soar by 280 percent since 2000, to 6 percent of 100,000 residents — the biggest leap of any jurisdiction in the state except the Washington suburbs. In Harrisonburg, a college town 100 miles north, Hispanics have reached 16 percent of 49,000 residents.
In many other areas of Goodlatte’s district, immigrants are a fast-growing part of the landscape and workforce — from Mexicans who pick apples and process poultry to Indians who work in high-tech and medical fields.
“Since I came here in the 1960s, Roanoke has gone from being a sleepy, segregated town to being a city of extraordinary diversity. Today we proudly celebrate having more than 104 different nationalities,” said Mayor David Bowers, a strong advocate of immigration reform whose wife is from Honduras and who unsuccessfully ran against Goodlatte in 1998.
Goodlatte, a member of Congress for 20 years, is well-liked across the district and holds frequent town meetings with constituents. Local leaders describe him as a practical, approachable politician who has promoted the region’s economic interests. These include agriculture, which has come to rely on low-wage Hispanic workers and periodically runs into problems with federal immigration officials.
Leaders of the state’s $3.8 billion poultry industry say they favor immigration reform, including some version of legalization for workers without papers. Goodlatte, supportive of the industry but opposed to legalization, has proposed expanding a national guest-worker program that would grant multi-year work visas to farm laborers from abroad.
Until recently, though, Goodlatte and his district had not faced the kinds of tensions over immigration that divide Congress and some areas of the country. Legal immigrants brought needed skills to the area, while illegal immigrants were unable to vote and posed no political threat. The total Hispanic population is still less than 6 percent of the district’s 738,000 residents.
But those dynamics are beginning to change. Emboldened by the growing electoral clout of Hispanics nationwide and by President Obama’s non-deportation policy for some young illegal immigrants, Hispanic activists in the district have begun speaking out and holding protests, demanding a halt to deportations and a path to citizenship. Some have targeted Goodlatte directly and traveled to Capitol Hill to support immigration reform.
“Some people see us as a plague, but we are here to work honorably,” said Ricardo Andrade, 30, a Mexican construction worker in Roanoke who has helped organize several protests outside Goodlatte’s local office. “Many have no papers, and they are scared of being deported. We want to overcome those fears and make our voices heard.”
In Washington, Goodlatte has come under attack from some on the right for being too willing to compromise with the Senate, which passed a bipartisan bill on immigration last year. The issue is stalled in the House, with uncertain prospects for revival. Goodlatte declined to be interviewed for this article but sent written comments through his staff.
