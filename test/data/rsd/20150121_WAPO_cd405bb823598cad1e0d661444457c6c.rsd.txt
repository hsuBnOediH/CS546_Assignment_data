Brown and Duke crack down on illegal activities at parties

Brown and Duke universities — two of the nation’s elite schools — are cracking down on illegal behavior at parties this semester, with each college sanctioning fraternities in the past week as part of an effort to curb excessive drinking and address sexual assault.
Brown University, in Providence, R.I., sanctioned two fraternities and banned registered events with alcohol in on-campus residences such as Greek system houses, while Duke University has suspended its Alpha Delta Phi fraternity chapter amid allegations of sexual assault in the fraternity’s off-campus house.
Campus sexual assault has been a significant issue at the nation’s colleges during the past year, with the White House pushing the “It’s on us” campaign against sexual violence and the Education Department going public with its investigation into sexual misconduct inquiries at dozens of U.S. schools. The attention has led some schools to focus on Greek life as one area that could be reformed.
The University of Virginia banned fraternity and sorority functions late last year after a Rolling Stone article alleged a culture of rape on that campus. Despite inaccuracies in the magazine account — and the fraternity at the center of it being cleared — U-Va. pushed forward with changes to its agreement with fraternities on campus, putting in place tighter controls over alcohol service and sober monitoring of parties.
The recent events at Brown and Duke are the latest examples of colleges trying to create safer environments for students.
Brown’s Sigma Chi fraternity lost its university privileges until 2016 after hosting a party at which a sexual assault allegedly took place, according to a statement from the university. The punishment for Brown’s Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, which hosted a party at which two students reported receiving date rape drugs in their drinks, is even harsher: Four years without university recognition or on-campus housing, according to the statement.
Margaret Klawunn, Brown University’s vice president for campus life and student services, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.
At Duke, in Durham, N.C., the university officially recognized the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity in 2013, though the house on campus has been a part of the national chapter since 2006, according to a report from the Chronicle, Duke’s student newspaper. The recent alleged sexual assault isn’t Alpha Delta Phi’s first brush with law enforcement: A previous incarnation of the fraternity was expelled from the national chapter and disaffiliated from Duke in 2002 for “violating rules regarding risk management, such as hazing and illegal alcohol use,” according to the Chronicle. The fraternity and the university’s office of fraternity and sorority life did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
President Obama didn’t mention the sexual assault issue, a major focus of his administration’s 2014 agenda, in his State of the Union address Tuesday night. But Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand’s (D-N.Y.) guest at the president’s speech served as a symbol of the issue’s ongoing relevance. Columbia University senior Emma Sulkowicz gained national prominence in September when she vowed to drag a mattress with her wherever she went until the student who she alleges raped her left the university. That student is still enrolled at the school.
