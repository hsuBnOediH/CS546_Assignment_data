Metro looks ahead to the possible FBI relocation to Greenbelt

There is a lot of talk about the planned relocation of the FBI headquarters from the dated J. Edgar Hoover Building in downtown Washington.
And with Greenbelt on the short list of sites where the agency could move, Metro is looking ahead to a major transformation of its Metrorail station there.
The transit agency is planning a January public hearing to present a plan that includes relocating bus bays and parking facilities in the event that Greenbelt is chosen for the agency’s new home.
The General Services Administration announced this summer that Greenbelt is one of three sites on the shortlist for relocation. The agency also is considering Landover, in Prince George’s County, and Springfield in Fairfax County.
Stan Wall, director of real estate and station planning at Metro, said bringing the FBI headquarters at Greenbelt would benefit Metro on many fronts, chiefly by creating a reverse commute and building ridership at the end of the Green Line.
The 78-acre Greenbelt Metro site includes a large commuter parking lot with space for 3,400 cars. The station also has about 300 Kiss & Ride parking spots and a bus loop with 17 bus bays. It has direct access from the southbound Capital Beltway into the station and an egress from the site to the northbound Capital Beltway.
Metro has been negotiating an agreement with Renard Development LLC to replace and relocate existing facilities to allow for the construction of a building that would accommodate the FBI’s 11,000 workers, plus multi-family housing, office and retail around the rail station. Metro says it will continue to work with Renard, the state of Maryland, Prince George’s County and the City of Greenbelt to refine the concept plan for the site and expects a final plan to be completed by the time of the public hearing.
The proposal envisions a transforming the Metro station from a sea of parking spaces into a vibrant, transit-oriented community. Metro projects the development would increase ridership at Greenbelt, which has decreased in the past decade to an average of 6,541 daily passenger boardings.
Wall said the proposal supports Metro’s strategic plan, known as Momentum He said it would improve regional mobility and connect communities through enhanced access of the station and encourage reverse commuting through the establishment of an employment center at the end of the Green Line. The project also would serve as a catalyst for development in the surrounding community.
Under the proposal Metro’s existing 3,400 commuter parking spaces would move to a garage in an area southwest of the station, with direct pedestrian access to the station. The Kiss & Ride spaces would be relocated to an area immediately southwest of the station entrance and would be on the ground level of a residential and retail complex. Metro’s bus loop would move to the southeast of the station entrance, on the ground level of a hotel and office building. The plan incorporates a secure bike facility, improved pedestrian access with the use of trails, and full access from the Beltway to the station.
Metro also proposes to establish a daily parking fee of $14.50 for non-Metro riders who wish to park the facility. Because the area would be largely developed and attract many new workers, Metro says it expects some of those new office workers would want to park at the Greenbelt Metro facilities. A “non-rider” parking fee would discourage them from parking there, Metro said. The regular daily parking fee at Greenbelt is $5.10.
If the GSA selects another location for the FBI, Metro’s agreement with the private developer will be terminated, Wall said.
