Deaths, injuries have plummeted in crashes with teen drivers

There has been a striking drop in the number of people killed and injured in car crashes involving teenagers over a 20-year span, but no one seems to be certain why.
Safety features such as air bags may be a factor, along with license restrictions on new teen drivers. Plus, gas costs a lot more than the 1994 price of $1.11 per gallon. The fact that many teenagers are in no rush to get a driver’s license also might play a role.
The number of people who died in crashes involving teen drivers dropped by 56 percent, and the number injured declined by 51 percent, according to federal data for the period from 1994 to 2013.
Teenage drivers have the highest crash rate of any age group. And 40 percent of the people killed — as well as half of those injured — in such crashes are not in the teen driver’s car.
Numbers compiled by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety from federal statistics show that 891,000 teenage drivers were involved in crashes in 2013. In 236,000 of those crashes, someone was injured; in 2,614 crashes, one or more people died.
States began recognizing the danger teen drivers posed to themselves and others in the 1990s by requiring teenagers to gain more driving experience before they received a full-fledged license. Under what are known as “graduated driver licensing” (GDL) programs, most states require a period of supervised driving before a teen can get a driving permit, as well as an intermediate stage in which teens have limited driving privileges.
Most states, and the District, ban all cellphone use by new drivers, restrict nighttime driving for intermediate drivers and limit the number of passengers a teenager may carry.
“Teen-crash rates have declined substantially, and a significant part of that is due to graduated driver licensing laws now in place in every state,” said Anne McCartt, senior vice president for research at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). The laws are aimed at taking beginning drivers out of the riskiest situations, such as driving at night or driving with other teen passengers in the car.
McCartt said many states could reduce teen-crash deaths by half if they adopted stronger laws. Among those states, by IIHS calculations: Montana, North and South Dakota, Iowa, Arkansas and Idaho.
A calculator created by IIHS indicates that by adopting the strongest GDL standards Virginia could reduce teen-crash fatalities by 37 percent and teen accidents by 15 percent; Maryland could reduce fatalities by 19 percent and crashes by 10 percent; and the District could reduce fatalities by 17 percent and accidents by14 percent.
The number of young people getting a driver’s license has declined, according to studies by the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute.
One study found the greatest decreases were among drivers in their late teens and early 20s. Near-constant contact via mobile devices was one reason, researchers said. That may have reduced the need for young people to socialize face to face.
