Crimea has joined the ranks of the world’s ‘gray areas.’ Here are the others on that list.

Last week National Geographic found itself in a controversial spot when a report in U.S. News and World Report suggested that the National Geographic Maps would show Crimea as part of Russia. “We map de facto, in other words we map the world as it is, not as people would like it to be,” Juan José Valdés, the magazine’s geographer and director of editorial and research, explained.
National Geographic has since clarified its position: In a statement, it announced that Crimea would be treated "shaded gray" to show that it was now an "Area of Special Status."
To put it simply, Crimea is now a gray area.
What other gray areas are there in the world? Well, according to National Geographic's Atlas of the World (ninth edition), quite a few. Here are the ones we could find (with National Geographic's notes):
National Geographic's list is far from exhaustive. For example, it could be argued that Tibet should be included over questions about China's sovereignty over the land. And the independence referendums due to be held this year in Scotland and Catalonia could lend themselves to the "gray area" tag, too. Really, we're only scratching the surface here: Wikipedia lists hundreds of territorial disputes. The world is a very gray place.
Looking over these gray areas, how does Crimea fit in? First, these disputed areas span almost all parts of the world, from the Falkland Islands at the very tip of the South American continent, to the Kiril Islands between eastern Russia and Japan. Many date back decades, if not centuries. Like Crimea's own complicated situation, the fall of the Soviet Union seems to have played a big role in a number of them, most notably in the cases of Transdniestria, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia.
These are also, almost without exception, places of conflict. The gray status of the West Bank and Gaza strip, Kosovo and Taiwan, is indicative of those areas' places at the center of the biggest and bloodiest international issues of the last century. What's more, these gray areas are remarkably resilient. For example, the dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the Falklands Islands goes back hundreds of years, and despite a bloody war over the islands in 1982 hasn't settled the situation. Argentina only recently announced it would not respect the results of the Falklands' own referendum on the islands' status.
Even those gray areas that seem relatively innocuous now could become problems in the future: The Senkaku Islands (known as the Diaoyu Islands in China) are expected by many to be a potential source of conflict in the coming years.
That's why, in many ways, National Geographic's decision on Crimea makes a lot of sense. The United States and other countries may not want to recognize Crimea as part of Russia, but the facts on the ground speak for themselves. On Saturday, Russian troops stormed a Ukrainian naval base on the peninsula. The ruble will soon be implemented; the clocks will even be put on Moscow time. Crimea has joined the ranks of the world's "gray areas." It may not be a good thing to be gray, but there's little anyone can do about it.
Correction 3/24/2014: The post originally said implied the Falklands War was in 1983 rather than 1982, and has been updated to fix that error.
