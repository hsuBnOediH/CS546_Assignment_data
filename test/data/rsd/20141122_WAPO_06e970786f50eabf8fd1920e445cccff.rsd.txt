Senators hope ambassador confirmation helps free American woman jailed in Timor-Leste

When a woman from Oregon was arrested in Timor-Leste for sharing a cab with someone carrying drugs, there was no official U.S. ambassador there to advocate on her behalf.
For nearly three months, Stacey Addison has been unable to leave the country. She had a court hearing on Oct. 29 and instead of being cleared to go home she was sent to a women’s prison where she’s been detained since.
Oregon’s two U.S. senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley sent a letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell after the midterms imploring them to make the confirmation of the U.S. ambassador to Timor-Leste a priority in the lame duck.
They wrote that the U.S. embassy in the southeast Asia country was working hard on her release, but “that any embassy’s ability to speak directly to the most senior foreign officials is limited in the absence of a U.S. Ambassador. What Dr. Addison’s case needs now is strong leadership in Dili (the capital of Timor-Leste).”
This week, the Senate worked to clear the backlog of ambassadors held up in the partisan wrangling over Democrats’ changing the filibuster rules for nomination votes.
At the top of the pile to be confirmed was Karen Stanton, who had been waiting more than 470 days since her nomination to be the U.S. ambassador in Timor-Leste. The Senate finally approved her, unanimously, on Monday.
Stanton likely would have been confirmed this week any way with the other career diplomats, but Wyden’s office says Senate leadership made sure she was done first because it understood the urgency of getting Stanton there for Addison.
Addison, who turned 41 this month in jail, was backpacking around the world when she crossed into Timor-Leste. Like a plot befit for a thriller, Addison was caught in the company of a stranger smuggling drugs.
“I took a shared car from the border to the capital city of Dili. Another passenger in the car asked to pick up a package from DHL. The parcel contained methamphetamine and everyone in the car was arrested. My bags were searched, my body was searched, all medications I am carrying were tested, and my urine was tested. Everything was negative but I was still arrested for drug trafficking,” Addison wrote on her Facebook page in September when she wasn’t allowed to leave the country, but not yet been jailed. 
Addison’s family has a “HelpOurStacey” Facebook page and Twitter account. They write in one tweet that she had to cut off her hair for prison. In another that she’s staying strong.
A State Department official said the U.S. has “actively” been working on Addison’s case since her initial arrest.
“Ambassador-designate Stanton is fully briefed on the case,” the official said. “Having an Ambassador in place will help elevate the U.S. government’s engagement with Timor-Leste authorities to ensure treatment consistent with internationally recognized standards and to ensure that the case proceeds expeditiously under local laws and international standards.”
Wyden said Friday he is hopeful the new ambassador’s presence will “make a real difference.”
