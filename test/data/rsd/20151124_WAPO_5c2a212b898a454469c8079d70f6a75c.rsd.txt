The Chinese food at Secret Chopsticks isn’t cheap or fast, and that’s the point

Most of the Chinese food we know and love is cheap and fast. At the new Secret Chopsticks in Rosslyn, it's neither.
Executive chef Robin Li said he's hoping his endeavor will bring some additional respect to the food of his home country. How he wants to do it: With nine-course tasting menus that range from $59 to $89 and take up to two hours to sample. (A la carte dishes are available in the lounge portion of the restaurant.)
"Chinese cuisine, it's just like French, Italian," he said. "It has a long history."
He added, "It's not just General Tso's chicken and crispy beef."

Li started his culinary career in China. Upon immigrating to America, he joined the U.S. Navy as a culinary specialist, a gig which helped send him for a time to study at the Culinary Institute of America. When he left the Navy, he returned to the school.
Back in China, he opened an American steakhouse. Secret Chopsticks is his first restaurant stateside.
At his steakhouse, "The only thing that's American is the food. Here, the only thing Chinese is the food." Secret Chopsticks employs modern, Asian-accented decor -- upside down parasols on the ceiling, for one -- throughout the 120-seat dining room and 10- to 12-seat lounge. The beverage program also hews to American practice, with a global wine list, cocktails and craft beer.
As to the food, "I want to do some real Chinese cuisine over here," Li said. To that end, he's seeking out less common ingredients to feature, including celtuce, lily root and Chinese yams. The chef also makes his own tofu, a daily two- to three-hour process.

Several of the bean curd-based dishes were among the highlights of a recent dinner at Secret Chopsticks, where we ordered the tofu ($59) and vegetarian ($59) tasting menus. (The dim sum menu is $79, the protein $89.) They included a chilled tofu with spicy sauce and a poached tofu ball in broth that reminded us of matzoh ball soup by way of China. Both menus included a kung pao-style dish -- or gung bao, as Li called it -- but most dishes were nothing like the greasy, goopy-sauced fare found in many Chinese American restaurants. The most familiar sauce: A sweet-and-sour dip served with a scary addictive plate of crispy tofu sticks.
Dishes come out about every 10 minutes or so, paced and sized well enough to leave you full but not uncomfortably so. Li said he's already thinking about a 13-course menu.
But first, "I need to test the water" with the nine-course meal, he said. He's hoping diners buy into the concept and the different style of food.
"If I do it this way, I think Americans will appreciate it," Li said.
