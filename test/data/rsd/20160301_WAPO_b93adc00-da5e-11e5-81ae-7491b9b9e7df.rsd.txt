South Texas’s only abortion clinic is battleground for major Supreme Court case

McALLEN, TEX. — The young woman lay on the exam table, waiting for her abortion. She expected pain. Tears. The grip of regret. But the dimly lit room smelled of lavender, and the nurse was asking about the butterfly tattoo on her right wrist.
“It’s beautiful,” the nurse said. “What’s it mean?”
“It’s for my daughter,” the woman replied. “My butterfly.”
She was 28, a single mother of three, her youngest 10 months old. She lived with her parents and was studying to become a medical assistant. She could not afford this procedure; her Catholic grandmother had slipped her the $440. She didn’t want to bring another child into poverty just as she was climbing out.
That was how she wound up at Whole Woman’s Health of McAllen, an abortion clinic in this border town that opened as a physician’s practice in 1971, two years before the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide. Thousands of women had undergone the procedure in the brick shoe box of a building, the setting for about 60 abortions a week.
Both the clinic and the political landscape have changed radically since those early years. Most recently, a Texas law imposed strict new requirements that the clinic could not meet. So the owner filed suit, arguing the law illegally restricts women’s right to an abortion. The case will be argued Wednesday before the U.S. Supreme Court, the most consequential abortion case to come before the court in a generation.
The debate over abortion often involves sweeping abstractions. But what happens inside this clinic — and just beyond its walls — illustrates how abortion is lived in America, 43 years after Roe v. Wade.
On one side are the clinic’s dedicated supporters, including its current owner, who are deeply engaged in an intensifying battle to push back against state restrictions. On the other are the protesters, the fiercest critics of abortion, who have flocked to this clinic as its profile has risen and other facilities around the state have been forced to close.
Opened by an Argentine immigrant, Peter Kowalyszyn, the clinic has long provided a range of family planning and health services for women in the rural Rio Grande Valley. At first, even some of Kowalyszyn’s closest colleagues did not know he also performed abortions.
Over time, however, word got out, and the clinic began attracting protesters. Juan Campos, a family doctor with an office next door, stopped speaking to Kowalyszyn. He lobbied town officials to shut the clinic down.
“We don’t let prostitution go around. Why are we allowing an abortion clinic?” Campos said. But the city was “afraid of lawsuits, so they didn’t do anything.”
Kowalyszyn had seen patients with complications from illegal abortions, and he wanted women in this predominantly Hispanic city to have safer options. Eventually he came to focus primarily on birth control and abortion. In 1999, he changed the clinic’s name to “Motherhood Choice.”
That year, Kowalyszyn’s wife, Ines, became general manager. With her husband aging, she sought a successor, eventually finding Amy Hagstrom Miller, a veteran abortion clinic administrator who had purchased an Austin clinic to keep it from going out of business.
