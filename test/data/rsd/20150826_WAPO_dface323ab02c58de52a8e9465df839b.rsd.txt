In yet another display of the Islamic State’s destruction, the Syrian government confirmed Sunday that the militant group destroyed the treasured Temple of Baal Shamin in the ancient city of Palmyra. 
As The Washington Post’s Justin Moyer reported, the temple which is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stood for almost two millennia and honors the Phoenician god of storms and rain.

On Tuesday, the Islamic State released images on a social media site use by the militants that appear to document the temple’s destruction accomplished by placing explosives inside and outside of the structure. The images are consistent with prior reports about the temple’s demise. As The Post’s Ishaan Tharoor reported the United Nations’ cultural agency, UNESCO, called the attack on the temple a war crime.
“Daesh placed a large quantity of explosives in the temple of Baal Shamin today and then blew it up causing much damage to the temple,” Maamoun Abdulkarim, Syria’s antiquities chief, told Agence France-Presse on Sunday, using another name for the Islamic State. “The [temple’s inner area] was destroyed and the columns around collapsed.”
