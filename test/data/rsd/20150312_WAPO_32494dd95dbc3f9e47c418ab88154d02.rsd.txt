How a teenager’s viral campaign to prove her citizenship is inspiring a new Texas bill

Alecia Faith Pennington describes herself as a Texan, born and raised. But in a video that went viral after she posted it on YouTube last month, Pennington said her parents never obtained a birth certificate or other basic documentation of her life, leaving her with “nothing to prove my identity” — or her U.S. citizenship. Because she was home-schooled, she also has no school records. That means, the 19-year-old said, that she’s unable to get a job, go to college or obtain a driver’s licence.
To make things worse, Pennington said in the February video, her parents have refused to sign an affidavit that would help her prove her place of birth, leaving her with few legal options. On Tuesday, a Texas legislator introduced a bill to try to change that.
The bill, inspired by Pennington’s campaign, would address some of the problems she says she encountered when she set out to prove her own citizenship. It would allow individuals to petition for a delayed birth certificate in the county where they live, rather than in the county in which they were born. It would also make it a misdemeanor for a parent to refuse to sign an affidavit to help their child obtain a delayed birth certificate.
“This bill is designed to make it easier for people like Faith to get a delayed birth certificate,” David Glenn, legislative director for Texas Rep. Marsha Farney (R), said in an e-mail. “If this measure had been in place today, it would have been easier for Faith to have her case heard in the county court and find representation during those court proceedings. It also would have required her parents to sign the affidavit or face jail time.”
Farney’s bill is the latest development in the conversation Pennington sparked about the rare, isolating experience of those who have U.S. citizenship but lack adequate proof. That conversation has implications everywhere, from the home-schooling and home-birth movements of which Pennington’s family is a part to an ongoing border debate about how the U.S.-born children of immigrants prove their citizenship.
Currently, Texans without birth certificates must apply for a delayed birth certificate by filing a petition in the county in which they were born. Pennington did that — but, she says, a judge told her that what proof she had of her existence wasn’t enough to move forward. That proof, Pennington says, included a baptism certificate, an affidavit from her grandmother and a doctor’s statement from when Pennington was about 9 years old.
Feeling that she had no other options, Pennington says she made the video that brought the national spotlight to her story. About a week after her video was posted, Pennington, her aunt, and her grandmother met with Farney, Glenn said. “At the meeting, we learned a lot about Faith’s family and how she had managed to stay ‘off the grid’ for so long,” Glenn said, adding that the conversation inspired Farney’s office to work on the new legislation.
