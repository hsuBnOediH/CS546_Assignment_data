‘They thought it was a bomb’: 9th-grader arrested after bringing a home-built clock to school

Fourteen-year-old Ahmed Mohamed just wanted to get noticed by his teachers.
Instead, he got arrested.
In an incident that has raised allegations of racism and made a Texas school district the target of online outrage, the ninth-grader was pulled out of school in handcuffs after a digital clock he built himself was mistaken for a bomb.
On Wednesday, Irving Police Chief Larry Boyd said that Mohamed would not be charged with any wrongdoing.
“We have no evidence to support that there was an intention to create alarm or cause people to be concerned,” Boyd said during a news conference after news of Mohamed’s arrest prompted a national outcry.
And the story of Mohamed’s arrest has made its way across the Internet and all the way to the White House.
“I’m the person who built a clock and got in a lot of trouble for it,” the jittery and smiling ninth-grader said during a press conference outside of his home after his arrest became national news.

Messages of support from President Obama, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Democratic presidential hopeful and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have buoyed the young man. He said on Wednesday evening that he was grateful for the support for his “movement” and he hoped to attend MIT.
Mohamed said it felt “outstanding” to receive so much support.
“I never thought it would get this far,” he added.
Mohamed, a self-assured kid with thick-framed glasses and a serious expression, had just started at MacArthur High School a few weeks ago. The Irving, Tex., ninth-grader has a talent for tinkering — he constructs his own radios and once built a Bluetooth speaker as a gift for his friend — and he wanted to show his new teachers what he could do. So on Sunday night, he quickly put together a homemade digital clock (“just something small,” as he casually put it to the Dallas Morning News: a circuit board and power supply connected to a digital display) and proudly offered it to his engineering teacher the next day.
But the teacher looked wary.
“He was like, ‘That’s really nice,’” Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News. “‘I would advise you not to show any other teachers.’”
During English class, the clock beeped, annoying his teacher. When he brought the device up to her afterward, she told him “it looks like a bomb,” according to Mohamed.
“I told her, ‘It doesn’t look like a bomb to me,'” he told the Dallas Morning News.

But the English teacher kept the clock, and during sixth period, Mohamed was pulled out of class by the principal and a police officer. They took him to a room where four other officers were waiting. When he entered, one officer leaned back in his chair and said, “That’s who I thought it was,” Mohamed told MSNBC.
“They interrogated me and searched through my stuff and took my tablet and my invention,” the teen said. “They were like, ‘So you tried to make a bomb?’ I told them no, I was trying to make a clock.”
But his questioner responded, “It looks like a movie bomb to me.”
