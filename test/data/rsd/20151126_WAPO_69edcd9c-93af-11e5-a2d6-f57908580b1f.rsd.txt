D.C. Water sues EPA over new limit on E. coli allowed in Potomac River

The District’s water and sewer utility has sued the Environmental Protection Agency, alleging that it improperly calculated new limits on the amount of E. coli that the region’s sewage treatment facility may discharge into the Potomac River.
D.C. Water says the EPA didn’t account for the fact that the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant can have spikes in E. coli levels when rain water rushes into the plant during storms. In addition to being in human waste, E. coli is found in animal waste that runs off lawns with rain water.
The lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court is being closely watched by sewer utilities across the country because they also must abide by limits on E. coli as specified in the permits that govern their wastewater treatment facilities.
D.C. Water said flaws in how the EPA calculated the new daily limits for its upcoming permit renewal would result in “unreasonable mandates” that would require as much as $1 billion in upgrades to the Blue Plains plant in Southwest D.C. Blue Plains, the largest such plant in the world, treats sewage for more than 2 million people in the District, and parts of suburban Maryland and Northern Virginia.
D.C. Water did not make anyone available for an interview Wednesday. In written responses to e-mailed questions, spokesman John Lisle said the previous limits required D.C. Water to “control” E. coli but allowed for “natural fluctuations” in bacteria levels during rain storms.
“The plant’s treatment performance already meets or exceeds that required to meet water quality standards,” Lisle wrote. “The revised requirement would not lead to measurable improvements to water quality."
Environmental activists say wastewater treatment plants are a major contributor of E. coli and other pathogens in the Potomac and other waterways. While most E. coli bacteria are harmless and often found in healthy people’s digestive systems, a toxic strain in waterways can make swimmers, rowers and other recreational users severely ill if they swallow water.
Like many older sewer utilities in the U.S., D.C. Water has been under scrutiny for years for the amount of pollution its sewer system sends into local streams and rivers. D.C. Water has a particular problem because older parts of its sewer system, built in the late 1800s, also carry stormwater and get overwhelmed in heavy storms. That causes untreated sewage to overflow directly into creeks and rivers before reaching the treatment plant.
Phillip Musegaas, legal director for the Potomac Riverkeeper environmental group, said D.C. Water should be able to sufficiently treat water before Blue Plains discharges it into the river.
“That’s a large, state-of-the-art plant that they’ve invested a lot of money in,” Musegaas said. “There’s no reason they can’t meet the daily standard.”
As part of a 2005 legal settlement with the U.S. government, D.C. Water has spent $1.5 billion to reduce sewer overflows into creeks and rivers. That includes building massive tunnels beneath the city that will hold rain water until a storm passes and the water can be pumped to Blue Plains. Other work includes expanding capacity at Blue Plains to better treat the sewage-rainwater mixture during heavy storms. The 20-year Clean Rivers Project is estimated to cost $2.6 billion total. The long-term construction plan was based on the previous E. coli limits.
