Obama makes a peculiar pick to showcase the countryâ€™s manufacturing revival

President Obama visited a small Indiana company today that he says shows the strength of American manufacturing and the jobs it creates throughout the supply chain.
But it was a peculiar choice.
The story of Millenium Steel in Princeton, Ind., is actually a complicated tale. It is a small minority owned business, founded solely to serve the Japanese auto giant Toyota. It has the word steel in its name, but it is a service company that only warehouses, delivers and cuts rolls of raw steel that is manufactured by bigger American companies. While Toyota and Millenium are having a good year, those big steel makers are struggling to stay afloat in the face of competition from China, which now produces nearly ten times as much steel as the United States.
Millenium Steel wouldn't exist were it not for Toyota's push a dozen years ago to make minority business enterprises 5 percent of its supply chain. In 2001, Toyota's affiliate Toyota Tsusho America and Henry Jackson, a Vietnam War vet and prominent Kentucky businessman who ran a plastics company supplying Toyota, became partners in Millenium Steel. Millenium Steel was one of seven minority business enterprises Toyota helped establish around that time, according to a 2004 report in Automotive News.
Millenium Steel isn't a steel manufacturer, though it is part of the manufacturing supply chain in between raw steel makers and Toyota.
It sits literally next door to Toyota's light truck making plant in Princeton (which makes Sienna minivans and Highlander SUVs), and it sits on the site of Toyota's plant in San Antonio (which makes Tundra and Takoma pickup trucks). In Toyota's Texas plant, it also gathers leftover steel for reclamation. Neither Millenium nor either of the two Toyota plants are unionized, something that a Democratic president in a different era might have paid more attention to.
In 2011, when it celebrated its 10-year anniversary, Millenium had 40 employees and $200 million in revenues. Today the private firm has about 50 employees, Toyota said.
This is one part of the American manufacturing story. In a different era, big U.S. automakers manufactured many of the components that they now outsource. Toyota's San Antonio plant employes 3,000 people directly, but also has 3,000 people working for independent suppliers on its plant site.
The White House also notes that the United States is on track to produce 13 million vehicles this year, the most since 2002 and an engine for suppliers like Millenium.
But Millenium doesn't tell the whole story of American manufacturing. U.S. steel companies that provide steel to companies like Millenium have been fighting to survive or prosper in the face of foreign, mostly Chinese, competition.
According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, U.S. steel makers produced 95.8 million net tons of steel in 2013. While that was a 46 percent improvement from the woeful economic year of 2009, it was down from 2012 and lower than any year from 2004 through 2008. This year output will be about the same.
In a sense this is the story of the American recovery. Things are a lot better than they were at the depths of the Great Recession, but they still aren't as good was they were before the economic crisis hit. The White House said that employment at U.S. steel and iron foundries was up 12 percent, or about 15,000 jobs.
Thomas J. Gibson, president of the American Iron and Steel Institute, looked on the bright side on Friday, the third annual "National Manufacturing Day."
