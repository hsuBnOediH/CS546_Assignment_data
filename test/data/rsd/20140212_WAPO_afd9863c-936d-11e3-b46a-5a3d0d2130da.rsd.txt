U.S. launches new global initiative to prevent infectious-disease threats

Faced with what they describe as a perfect storm of converging threats from infectious-disease epidemics, U.S. officials launched a global effort Thursday with more than two dozen countries and international organizations to prevent deadly outbreaks from spreading.
The goal is to prevent, detect and respond to infectious-disease threats where they start. That’s more effective and less costly than treating sick people after diseases spread. The new initiative is ­intended to bolster security at ­infectious-disease laboratories, strengthen immunization programs and set up emergency ­response centers that can react to outbreaks within two hours.
Despite advances in medicine and technology, Americans are at greater risk than ever from new infectious diseases, drug-resistant infections and potential bioterrorism organisms, said Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is spearheading the initiative.
On Thursday — even though federal offices in Washington were closed because of a major snowstorm — Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius welcomed officials to a meeting held at department headquarters to launch the effort. “Global health security is a shared responsibility. No one country can achieve it alone,” she said. “A threat anywhere is indeed a threat everywhere.”
Lisa Monaco, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said biological threats can “emerge quickly, travel quickly and take lives.” She cited the H7N9 bird flu virus, a virus first reported in China last year, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Diseases that until recently weren’t found in the United States have become widespread, including mosquito-borne illnesses related to West Nile ­virus. There has also been a resurgence of diseases such as drug-resistant tuberculosis, a particularly dangerous form of the infectious lung disease.
Reports of TB are not uncommon in the Washington area and other major metropolitan areas, which typically are home to large immigrant populations and professionals who travel overseas frequently. Recently, there was a tuberculosis case at a Montgomery County high school , and three cases were reported at a Fairfax County high school in June. 
In recent weeks, another mosquito-borne virus common in Africa and Asia has spread quickly through the eastern Caribbean, appearing for the first time in the Western Hemisphere. Chikun­gunya fever, which is similar to dengue, was reported in December on the French side of St. Martin and has spread to seven other jurisdictions, including Martinique, Guadeloupe and the British Virgin Islands.
International regulations require nations to report outbreaks quickly to the World Health Organization, but most countries have not complied.
“We hope this will be the shot in the arm, energizing the global health security agenda,” Andrew Weber, assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, said in conference call with reporters Wednesday.
The WHO, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, and the World Organization for Animal Health are also participating in the effort.
This year, the CDC and the Defense Department are committing $40 million to work with 10 countries, including Uganda and Vietnam. The CDC recently completed pilot programs in those countries to improve diagnostic testing and transportation of potentially infectious samples.
Uganda has battled the deadly Ebola virus, cholera and multidrug-resistant TB. Vietnam has experienced outbreaks of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and the H5N1 bird flu strain. The SARS pandemic of 2003, which began in China, killed nearly 800 people in more than 30 countries, and its cost was estimated at $30 billion after just a few months.
