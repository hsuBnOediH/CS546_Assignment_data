The private Sidwell Friends School, where President Obama’s two daughters attend, went into emergency security mode twice this week with both a lockdown and an evacuation, according to an e-mail sent to parents.
Ellis Turner, interim head of the school, sent an e-mail to parents (see text below) late Friday afternoon, reporting that the school “put our emergency plan into action on two separate occasions.”
On Monday, he said, middle and upper school students on the Northwest Washington campus were ordered inside “due to police activity in the area.” After a few minutes, normal activities resumed.
Then, on Thursday, students, faculty and staff evacuated to the baseball field because of a “threatening phone call,” he said in the e-mail. Though the e-mail did not say what the threat was, sources said it was a bomb scare. Police searched the campus and allowed normal activity to resume after about 30 minutes. One parent said that some of the children were “shaken up” as a result.
Both Sasha Obama, 13, and Malia Obama, 16, attend school at the Northwest Washington campus.
