Tank-destroying missiles bound for U.S. discovered on passenger flight, news reports say

Bomb-sniffing dogs apparently discovered two U.S-made anti-tank Hellfire missiles on a passenger plane at Belgrade Airport in Serbia over the weekend, according to a report in the Associated Press.
The missiles were found Saturday and, according to media reports, had been transported on an Air Serbia flight that had come from Beirut. According to shipping documents, the payload had a final destination in Portland, Ore.
According to Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, the missiles were inert and were being transported by a contractor.
In June 2015, the U.S. State Department approved a possible sale of 1,000 Hellfire missiles to Lebanon through the Foreign Military Sales Program. In October 2015, approximately 50 Hellfires were delivered to the Lebanese Armed Forces, according to a statement from the U.S. embassy in Beirut. The missiles were part of an $8.6 million aid package to help secure the country’s borders from terrorist groups such as the Islamic State.
If true, a Serbian bomb-sniffing dog’s discovery of two Hellfire missiles aboard a passenger aircraft would not be the first recent mishap featuring the U.S. munition.
In 2014, an inert Hellfire meant to be used for training purposes was accidentally sent from Europe to Cuba, according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal. The missile, although missing some key components, still contained various sensors and sensitive pieces of technology that U.S. officials were concerned about losing to potential adversaries. The dummy missile was returned last month after more than a year of negotiations between the United States and Cuba.
The AGM-114 Hellfire can be fired from different platforms from both the ground and air. The missile is frequently used by U.S. aircraft such as helicopter gunships and armed drones. Initially designed to defeat Soviet tanks, the laser-guided missiles have been used almost exclusively in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to destroy things from high value individuals to pickup trucks and houses. The missiles have a range of roughly five miles.
While smuggling missiles commonly fired from warplanes on a passenger aircraft might seem extraordinary, transporting weapons on commercial aircraft is not entirely uncommon. In 2014, a Delta Airlines worker was charged with transporting more than 150 firearms on a series of flights between May and December of that year.
