The Supreme Court decision striking down the ‘born in Israel’ passport law, explained
Monday, June 8, 2015 13:46:06 GMT-05:00
More than a decade ago, Congress passed a law allowing Americans born in Jerusalem to list "Israel" as their birthplace on their passports.
But for the past 60 years, the U.S. has also said that it doesn't recognize Jerusalem as belonging to Israel.
On Monday, the Supreme Court called the passport law unconstitutional. Congress, the justices said, overstepped its constitutional duties with the law because it undermined the president’s ability to recognize sovereign foreign nations. And when it comes to that, only the president can decide.
The decision ends a sometimes-complicated and always-very-touchy case that carries quite a bit of political history. Here's what you need to know about it.
Let's start with the law in question
In 2002, Congress passed a spending bill that had the controversial passport provision attached. A skeptical President George W. Bush signed the bill into law but said he wouldn't enforce it. It violated America's long-held official position of neutrality over who actually has sovereignty over Jerusalem, he said.
President Obama has also said he thinks the law would make him choose one side in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and has refused to enforce it.
What, exactly, did the Supreme Court rule?
That the president, and only the president, has the right to recognize foreign nations. It's unconstitutional for Congress to pass any law that even inadvertently subverts which countries the United States recognizes, the Supreme Court said.
"Recognition is a topic on which the nation must speak with one voice,” wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in the majority opinion. “That voice must be the President’s.”
But not every justice agrees
As we said, the ruling was 6-3, with the court's four liberal justices — Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — joining the more moderate Kennedy.
The three dissenters differ on the passport law's reading. They say having Jerusalem-born Americans' passports say Israel does not undermine the president's power to recognize a country.
Chief Justice John Roberts said, "The statute at issue does not implicate recognition," but "simply gives an American citizen born in Jerusalem the option to designate his place of birth as Israel for the purposes of passports and other documents."
It took seven months for the justices to come to this conclusion — the longest-pending decision with the court, USA Today reports — which perhaps underscores the sensitive nature of the constitutional question at hand.
This case has been to the Supreme Court before
The Supreme Court actually looked at the passport issue three years ago. Back then, as our own Robert Barnes writes, it was a much broader debate on whether the courts could even chime in on the law or whether this was a "political question" that Congress and the president had to figure out.
The Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that this was a constitutional question that the courts should settle. The ruling sent it back to lower courts, and then the actual question on the law's constitutionality made its way back up the ladder.
According to Barnes, the law only affects about 50,000 Americans, including the cases' plaintiff, Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky, who was born in 2002 in Jerusalem. But the politics are much bigger.
So, remind me again. Which country has sovereignty over Jerusalem?
