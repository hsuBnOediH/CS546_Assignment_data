Man arrested after undercover video reveals alleged abuse at Perdue chicken supplier

Warning: This video contains graphic images of alleged animal abuse.
 
The pattern is familiar: An animal rights group with an agenda films an undercover video that allegedly captures animal abuse at a well-known meat supplier; the supplier denies the video is accurate, or tries to spin it for its own purposes; for meat-lovers the world over reluctant to give up their favorite dishes, life goes on.
Yet, after a video released this week showed apparent mistreatment of chickens at Perdue, an agribusiness giant, this pattern may be changing. First, the company praised the undercover investigation and subsequent police involvement. And second, because a controversial law will soon limit what people can say about what they see at factory farms, this may be the last such video from North Carolina the world sees for a long while.
The drama began this week when Mercy for Animals (MFA), an organization that aims to “end factory farming,” as its website explained, released graphic video it said showed chickens being mistreated at Deese Farm and Hideaway Farms in Rockingham, N.C. The charges and video came amid attempts — fueled by undercover investigations, concerns about global warming, and charges that the use of antibiotics in slaughterhouses contributes to antibiotic resistance — to start a nationwide debate over whether animal agriculture is worth the costs.
MFA claimed to have witnessed:
 
“Extreme cruelty to animals is business as usual at Perdue,” MFA’s president, Nathan Runkle, said in a press release. “Chickens are crammed into filthy, windowless sheds, kicked and thrown by careless workers, and bred to grow so fast they suffer from painful leg deformities and heart attacks. Perdue has not only the power, but also the ethical responsibility to end the worst forms of cruelty to animals in its supply chain. It’s time Perdue took real steps to prevent the suffering of millions of animals.”
News soon came that poultry worker Danny Cajija Miranda, 22, was charged with four counts of animal cruelty. But unlike, say, Whole Foods — which, just last month, stood by a supplier accused of mistreating Thanksgiving turkeys — Perdue did not condemn MFA’s potentially embarrassing efforts. Instead, the chicken company appeared ready to work with a group set on putting it out of business.

“We have seen the video taken by Mercy for Animals on a farm raising chickens for Perdue,” the company said in a statement. “We are appalled by the mistreatment and abuse by a contract catching crew and a farm worker shown in the video. We are committed to working with law enforcement to identify everyone involved and hope the Mercy for Animals will cooperate to facilitate those efforts. We are committed to taking aggressive actions to hold those involved accountable and prevent similar behavior in the future.”
In a later statement, Perdue even expressed its gratitude to MFA.
“We thank Mercy for Animals for uncovering clear animal abuse by an individual on a farm raising our chickens, and we appreciate law enforcement’s prompt action against the perpetrator,” the statement read. “This also demonstrates that we need to improve our oversight, training and practices around day-to-day care of our animals.”
MFA, however, wasn’t backing down. This was about more than one guy who squished a few chickens.
