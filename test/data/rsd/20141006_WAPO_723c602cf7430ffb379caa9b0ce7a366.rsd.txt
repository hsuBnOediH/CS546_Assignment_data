States issue first marriage licenses after Supreme Court declines appeals

County clerks in five states began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on Monday just hours after the Supreme Court declined to take up appeals of two lower court rulings.
Hours after the Supreme Court’s order, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, which this summer struck down marriage bans in Oklahoma and Utah, lifted its stay.
Elsewhere, county clerks began issuing licenses on their own. Clerks in Marion County, Ind., and Dane County, Wis., granted marriage licenses to same-sex couples before noon.
And in Virginia, the fifth state impacted by Monday’s ruling, the first same-sex marriages were performed in Charlottesville and Richmond shortly after 1 p.m. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over Virginia, lifted a stay on its own ruling, too.
The Supreme Court ruling wasn’t completely unexpected. County clerks in Oklahoma had begun preparing to issue licenses after the 10th Circuit’s initial decision by changing the wording on some forms, The Oklahoman reported. Oklahoma County Court Clerk Tim Rhodes said his office would begin issuing licenses once the 10th Circuit stay was lifted.
Colorado Attorney General John Suthers (R) said Monday that county clerks in his state must begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In a statement, Suthers said his office expects the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals to issue a final ruling ordering Colorado to issue the licenses after the Supreme Court declined to take up an appeal.
“Once the formalities are resolved clerks across the state must begin issuing marriage licenses to all same-sex couples,” Suthers said in a statement.
Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen issued a similar statement, calling for “everyone to respect the Court’s action and to administer the law fairly and impartially” once the stay on same-sex marriages is officially lifted.
In Colorado, the ruling meant the marriages of more than 300 couples earlier this year, which had been put on hold, were suddenly valid. Several county clerks began issuing marriage licenses in June, after the 10th Circuit overturned Utah’s ban on marriage. Suthers went to court to stop the licenses, and the state Supreme Court ordered clerks to stop issuing them on July 18.
Salt Lake County said it would be able to begin issuing marriage licenses for same-sex couples as soon as the 10th Circuit stay was lifted and it received direction from the Utah attorney general’s office. Following a mandate issued by the 10th Circuit a couple in Salt Lake County applied for a license.
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert (R) and Attorney General Sean Reyes (R) said they would comment on the Supreme Court’s decision this afternoon.
In Wisconsin, Milwaukee County Clerk Joseph J. Czarnezki told the Washington Post that his legal counsel advised his office it could begin issuing licenses “as soon as we received word” of the Supreme Court’s decision not to hear the case.
But, he added earlier on Monday morning, “nobody’s come in yet.” The same was true in Waukesha County, where County Clerk Kathleen Novack said she was prepared to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples seeking them, but “at this point, we have not had anyone come in.”
