A deadly landslide exposes the depths of China’s corruption and censorship

DISASTERS, BOTH natural and man-made, tear a hole in society. When that tear comes in a place such as China, systemic failures often are exposed as well as lives lost and dreams crushed. The landslide that came roaring down on the Chinese city of Shenzhen on Dec. 20 underscores yet again the dangers of unbridled growth, lax safety inspections, corruption, unaccountable government and lack of rule of law.
Shenzhen has special significance for China: It is the location of the first of the special economic zones that eventually turned the nation into the low-cost manufacturing floor of the globe. Hundreds of millions of Chinese migrated to work in its booming factories. The plants spread for miles in every direction along with drab dormitories where workers were boarded, their laundry fluttering in the wind.
More recently, Shenzhen was attempting to reinvent itself anew as a high-tech hub, and the construction disgorged enormous quantities of waste. In 2013, a dump was opened in an old quarry on the outskirts of the city. Trucks rumbled to the site day and night, unloading dirt and debris until it became a mammoth heap. The operators of the dump were paid by the truckload, so there was incentive to take in as much as possible, despite the risks. And the risks were not unknown. According to the New York Times, last October the Shenzhen Evening News published a lengthy investigation of the city’s overwhelming amount of construction waste. The Wall Street Journal reported that a local environmental monitoring firm proposed on Dec. 16 to suspend the landfill’s operations pending efforts to address some of the safety risks it had identified.
Four days later, the landfill turned into a deadly avalanche of red mud, crashing into some of the dormitories below and burying residents alive. More than 70 people are missing, and only a dozen have been pulled alive from the wreckage.
The catastrophe quite possibly could have been prevented with better management and attention to safety, but over and over again, disasters in China point to an economic system in which safety and the environment have been neglected by business and the party-state. Baby formula was found to be adulterated in 2008 ; high-speed trains collided on a viaduct in Zhejiang province in 2011; massive explosions ripped apart a chemical storage facility in August at the port of Tianjin. Even natural disasters such as the 2008 Sichuan earthquake exposed failings: Thousands of children died when shoddily built schools collapsed on them.
Disasters happen everywhere, including the United States, which has seen in recent years bridges collapse, trains derail, planes crash. In some ways what distinguishes China most is the response.
When disaster strikes, Chinese officials have attempted to censor news reports or lay blame on low-level bureaucrats or underlings. An encouraging sign in recent years has been unrestrained cries of popular outrage on social media.
But long after the catastrophe has passed, the larger failure remains unaddressed: a system of arbitrary rule from above that is never required to answer to the people. It seems to be the one edifice in China that doesn’t quaver and fall.
