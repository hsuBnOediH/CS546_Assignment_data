Police arrested a Northwest Washington man in connection with the slaying of another man found dead in his Fairmount Heights home, authorities announced Wednesday.
Lexus Henderson, 22, was taken into custody Monday night after police pulled him over in the District driving a car that went missing from the crime scene, Prince George’s County authorities said.
Police say Henderson fatally stabbed 31-year-old Rafael Frazier after the two men got into an argument, though they did not say what prompted the disagreement.
Police found Frazier in his home on the 1600 block of Woodhill Court at about 7:50 a.m. Tuesday after someone asked authorities to check on his welfare, authorities said.
When police entered Frazier’s home, they found him “suffering from multiple stab wounds” and pronounced him dead on the scene, authorities said.
It is unclear who owns the car that went missing from the crime scene.
Henderson was charged with first-degree murder and will be extradited from D.C. to Prince George’s County, police said.
