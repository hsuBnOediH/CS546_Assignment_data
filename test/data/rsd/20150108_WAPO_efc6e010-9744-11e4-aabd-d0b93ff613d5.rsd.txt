Why scientists guessed wrong on this year’s flu vaccine, and why it could happen again

In early March, Robert Daum and other infectious-disease experts from around the country will gather in a Silver Spring, Md., hotel to choose the influenza strains that vaccine makers should target for next year’s flu season.
It’s an annual guessing game of sorts, one backed by data but also plagued with uncertainty. And when the guesses don’t exactly match the reality, as happened this past year, it can mean a dismal and deadly flu season.
“We’ll do the best we can,” said Daum, a Chicago doctor who heads the Food and Drug Administration advisory committee that makes the recommendations. But “the virus is smarter than we are at this point. I don’t know of any disease that plagues us more. It’s very, very frustrating and a very inexact science. . . . We do it with varying luck, and I think the luck is mostly the virus’s whim.”
As it does each year, the group will pore over surveillance information from around the globe, hear presentations from government researchers and weigh recommendations from the World Health Organization. The experts will cast their votes for the four specific flu strains — two each from the “A” and “B” types ofthe virus — that manufacturers should focus on in making the coming season’s vaccine. Then, they will wait and hope.
Daum said he suspects he’ll leave feeling the way he so often has in the past — head hanging, discouraged, wishing there was a more reliable way to protect people from the yearly scourge of the flu.
Despite constant tracking and surveillance of the virus in labs across the world and the work of hundreds of experts at universities, the WHO and agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, picking the correct flu strains still involves a measure of good fortune. Every few years, experts miss the mark.
“It’s inherently hard,” said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. “The one thing the flu is, is unpredictable.”
Global health experts had barely finished making their predictions last year when one of the strains they chose, a virulent type of H3N2 influenza, began to morph. “No sooner than the wheels started turning we started to see a glimpse of a different H3N2 emerging,” Fauci said. This “drift,” as experts call it, rendered this season’s vaccine far less effective than initially expected.
“Even in a good year, the flu vaccine isn’t as good as most of our vaccines. Its efficacy is around the 60, 65 percent range, which is, you might say, passable, but not what we would like,” CDC Director Thomas Frieden said Friday. That rate means that, in a year when the strains closely match the vaccine, about two-thirds of those who get flu shots are far less likely to become so sick that they require a visit to a doctor.
While the agency has not yet published vaccine-effectiveness figures for the current flu season, Frieden said, the numbers are likely to be significantly lower because of the changing nature of the H3N2 virus.
Such viral drift has been a persistent problem over the years, although less devastating than the “antigenic shift” that occasionally occurs, creating an entirely new strain that leaves much of the population defenseless. That’s what led to the 2009 flu pandemic.
