Cargo ship likely sank during hurricane, Coast Guard says

Shortly before her hulking cargo ship, the El Faro, vanished in 40-foot waves with a single emergency ping, a young crew member named Danielle Randolph sent her mother one last e-mail: “There is a hurricane out here and we are heading straight into it.”
On Monday, after a four-day hunt for the lost ship amid the whipping winds of Hurricane Joaquin, the Coast Guard said the vessel had probably sunk in a 15,000-feet-deep expanse of the Atlantic Ocean. The few signs of its 33 crew members included a floating body in a survival suit and an empty lifeboat, barely visible in the waves.
The disappearance of the El Faro, in one of the country’s deadliest cargo-shipping disasters in decades, has devastated the families of its 28 U.S. and five Polish oceangoing workers, who regularly carted cars and groceries between Florida and Puerto Rico aboard a vessel whose name in Spanish means “the lighthouse.”
But it has also cast a harsh light on the dangers inherent in cargo shipping, the unglamorous but vital industry tasked with shepherding supplies across unpredictable seas. Maritime experts have begun to raise questions about whether the growing pressure to run fast, cheap routes could have persuaded ship leaders to ignore safer but slower courses that could have kept the vessel away from a battering storm.
“These guys went right into it,” said Bernie Marciniak, a retired cargo-ship captain. “Had he just gone straight down the coast of Florida against the Gulf Stream, he would have burned a lot more fuel. Had he gone the other way and survived it, his job might have been on the line.”
TOTE Maritime Puerto Rico, the ship’s owner and a subsidiary of the Seattle shipping conglomerate Saltchuk Resources, said the vessel was routinely inspected for safety and pointed to a series of internal and third-party hull, machinery and safety checks earlier this year. Its crew, the company said, was made up of experienced mariners who had trained regularly on how to abandon ship and brave the rough weather common along its Caribbean route.
Commercial ships often launch from ports amid forecasts of storms because of the costs and risks of staying anchored, experts said. The company said it authorized the El Faro’s sailing “knowing that the crew are more than equipped to handle situations such as changing weather.”
But maritime experts such as Bill Doherty, a retired U.S. Navy captain who said he knew some of the El Faro crew members, said the 40-year-old freighter’s age could have compounded the dangers faced by tumultuous seas.
“That ship has been in extended life support for 20 years,” Doherty said. “It’s the ships that are beyond their safe useful life, it isn’t the people that are sailing them. They have got to be the best sailors in the world because of the equipment that they are faced with.”
The National Transportation Safety Board said it will investigate the loss of the El Faro. Responding to criticism from maritime experts, Mike Hanson, a spokesman handling crisis communications for TOTE, said, “All of those issues will be investigated in detail, and it will come out in due time.”
