Diplomatic fashion crisis averted: Michelle Obama wears Vera Wang to China state dinner

It wasn’t exactly an apology or a mea culpa. Call it a diplomatic clarification. Or a gesture of goodwill to Seventh Avenue.
For Friday’s state dinner in honor of Chinese president Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan, first lady Michelle Obama chose a custom mermaid gown from Vera Wang Collection. It was an inky black floor-length dress in silk crepe with a hand-draped skirt and organza sleeves. It exuded Hollywood glamour of the sort that has long defined the red carpet. And Obama’s hair, styled in gentle waves and cascading down her right cheek, underscored the dress’s mood of old-fashioned stardust.

But more important than the color of the gown, its luxurious fabric or its body-conscious fit, was its lineage. It was created by a Seventh Avenue veteran of Chinese heritage. Wang, 66, was born in New York, but her parents were born in Shanghai and immigrated to the United States.
“It is such a privilege, as an American of Chinese heritage, to have dressed first lady Michelle Obama for this state dinner honoring President Xi Jinping and First Lady Peng Liyuan, of the People’s Rebublic of China,” tweeted Wang.
The designer began her career at Vogue and later as a designer at Ralph Lauren. When she launched her signature brand in the early 1990s, it was focused on bridal wear — minimalist, elegant and refined — and she attracted a wealthy and celebrity clientele. She eventually expanded into sportswear and eveningwear. In recent years, she developed a less expensive line for Kohl’s.
Who would design the first lady’s state dinner gown was more than an aesthetic curiosity. It was a matter of smoothing the ruffled feathers of an American fashion industry that had felt snubbed when, for a China state dinner in 2011 in honor of president Hu Jintao, Obama selected a fiery red gown from the British label Alexander McQueen.

It was a dynamic dress but American designers wondered why she would not have chosen to celebrate one of their own on such a significant public occasion. The Council of Fashion Designers of America went so far as to issue a statement expressing the trade group’s disappointment.
Obama always maintained that the choice of the McQueen dress was purely a matter of personal preference and not a political statement of disaffection with Seventh Avenue. Still, the decision stung.
Adding to the injury, in 2011 Obama didn’t even give American designers a nod with her choice of attire for the morning’s traditional arrival ceremony. She wore an embellished dress by the Serbian-born, London-based designer Roksanda Illincic.
No one quibbled about the aesthetics of either ensemble, just the symbolism. On this most studied and parsed of days, when her words would be few but her appearance would speak volumes, Obama declined to articulate the virtues of the American fashion industry.
But in Take Two, Obama not only turned to an American label for the main event, she wore an American brand to the White House arrival ceremony. Obama chose a custom dress and coat from 3.1 Phillip Lim, a New York-based brand founded by Phillip Lim and Wen Zhou.
