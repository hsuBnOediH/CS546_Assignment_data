The jury, consisting of five men and seven women, deliberated for about 35 hours over seven days after receiving the case late last week. Hernandez will be sentenced later Wednesday, and he can appeal the verdict.

Hernandez was accused of murdering Lloyd, a 27-year-old landscaper from Boston who was found riddled with bullets in a Massachusetts field in June 2013. In its closing statements last week, the defense admitted that Hernandez was present when Lloyd was shot and killed but maintained that Hernandez was not the shooter, as the prosecutors allege. Because Hernandez was being tried as the shooter and not merely an accomplice, the defense argued he should be found not guilty. The defense also cited the prosecution’s supposed lack of hard evidence that proved conclusively that Hernandez shot Lloyd and a lack of proven motive on Hernandez’s part.

Dan Wetzel of Yahoo Sports, who has covered the trial since its start, summed up the prosecution’s winning argument, despite the absence of the murder weapon:
Hernandez’s legal issues are not over. He faces another trial, tentatively scheduled for May, for an alleged 2012 double murder.
Hernandez spent three seasons in the NFL after playing college football at the University of Florida. In 2011, he caught a career-high 79 catches for 910 yards and seven touchdowns for the Patriots, forming the league’s best tight end tandem with Rob Gronkowski. After that season, Hernandez signed a five-year contract extension worth a maximum value of $40 million, with a $12.5 million signing bonus.
Hernandez’s last game was the AFC championship game in January 2013.
