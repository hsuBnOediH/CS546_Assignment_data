Authorities in Richmond said an office building a few blocks from the state capitol was evacuated Wednesday morning after someone made a bomb threat.
Officials said nothing was found after the building was searched, however, and there were no reports of injuries. There were also no arrests made in the case.
Gene Lepley, a spokesman for the Richmond police, said the incident began about 9:30 a.m. when authorities received a call at the cityâ€™s call center warning of a bomb threat at the 730 East Broad Street office building, which houses some city of Richmond office workers. It was not immediately known how many people work in that office building.
The building was evacuated and the employees were sent to buildings nearby in the pouring rain.
Police said they brought in a bomb squad that included three dogs and searched the property floor by floor. Nothing was found, according to Lepley.
The incident was over at 10:45 a.m.
