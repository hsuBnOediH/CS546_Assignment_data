Ferguson police continued crackdown on protesters after federal, state interventions

Despite federal and state attempts to intervene during the two months since 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed, the Ferguson Police Department continued — and even accelerated — efforts to suppress peaceful protests using arbitrary and inconsistently applied arrest policies, according to Justice Department officials who are investigating the department and county police officials who have since taken over for the city.
A Washington Post review of city, county and state arrest records, and interviews with Justice Department officials, Ferguson and St. Louis County police chiefs, dozens of protesters and several civil rights officials reveal numerous questionable practices.
Hundreds of protesters have been arrested since August for violating unwritten rules and committing minor offenses, such as failure to disperse or unlawful assembly, and for violating a noise ordinance. Many have been taken to jail without being told what charges they may face and have often been released without any paperwork. For weeks, officers employed a “five-second rule” under which any protester who stopped walking was subject to arrest — a policy ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge this week. At least one officer patrolling protests wore a wristband that said “I am Darren Wilson,” referencing the officer whom protesters want jailed and prosecuted for the Aug. 9 shooting of Brown. County Police Chief Jon Belmar confirmed that an officer wore one of the wristbands and said that he understood why protesters felt taunted.
And, in recent weeks, protesters have complained that bail amounts are rising, jail time has increased and their organizers were routinely plucked from crowds of 100 to 300 people and arrested.
The controversial practices continued into October, until Belmar stepped in — stripping jurisdiction for policing the protests from the thinly stretched Ferguson station. In an interview with The Post, Belmar said that, under the Ferguson Police Department’s command, laws and policies were being enforced arbitrarily.
“We have a real issue when we start taking away people’s ability to express their opinions,” Belmar said.
Belmar’s team takes over as the black residents of greater St. Louis remain intensely skeptical of officers. Tensions again flared Wednesday night when residents got word of another police shooting. Dozens of protesters surfaced in St. Louis, where an 18-year-old black man was shot and killed after allegedly fleeing and shooting at an off-duty officer. The man’s family members and protesters insist he was unarmed. Police say they’ve recovered a weapon.
There is potential for more tension this weekend when hundreds of out-of-town protesters are expected to flood Ferguson and the St. Louis metro area for a series of organized demonstrations against police mistreatment.
Officials with the Ferguson Police Department did not respond to Post requests for comment about the criticism they are facing.
In an earlier interview about the Justice Department’s intervention and help, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson continued to defend his officers.
“Even if it’s a small group, there’s a very effective group of violent individuals who are looking for confrontation and the best way to avoid that confrontation is to bring in assistance from other agencies,” Jackson said. “So although it doesn’t feel good to need to have assistance, I am deeply grateful to those who have come to help us, and I’ll never be able to fully express my gratitude or make it up to them.”
On Sept. 4, the Justice Department announced that its Community Oriented Policing Service Office would begin to work with community groups and police officials in St. Louis to assess and make recommendations regarding officer training, use of force, handling mass demonstrations, stops, searches, arrests, and fair and impartial policing. The department is also conducting a broad civil rights investigation into the Ferguson Police Department.
