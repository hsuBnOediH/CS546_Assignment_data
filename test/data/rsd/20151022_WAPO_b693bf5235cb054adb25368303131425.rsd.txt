Fannie Mae puts headquarters up for sale, could fetch more than $200 million

In December, work is scheduled to begin on Fannie Mae’s new downtown headquarters, which means it’s time to sell the old place.
Fannie is putting three of its headquarters buildings on the market this week, with experts expecting that the three, including the central building at 3900 Wisconsin Ave. NW, could be acquired by schools or turned into a high-end housing complex.
Employees of the mortgage finance giant will remain in their current digs until late 2017, when they begin moving to a new headquarters to be built in place of The Washington’s Post’s headquarters. The rest of Fannie’s employees are due to arrive in mid-2018.
The move was prompted in part by expiring leases in rented space Fannie occupies elsewhere.
Commercial real estate experts said that although Fannie’s departure from Wisconsin Avenue had been anticipated for years, it is difficult to guess how much the properties would sell for because of the wide array of possible uses for them. Collectively the D.C. government assessed the three properties for sale, 3900 Wisconsin along with 4250 Connecticut Ave. and 3939 Wisconsin Ave. NW, at $201. 4 million this year.
The central building, a stately brick complex that has housed Fannie Mae operations since 1958, isn’t likely to be used as an office by whomever buys it, said Paul Hanafin, corporate managing director at the real estate firm Savills Studley.
“What makes it unique is just architecturally, it’s not everyday that someone tries to recreate Williamsburg in downtown Washington,” Hanafin said. Employers today are gravitating more urban neighborhoods downtown.
“If you look at an office building being designed today, it’s pretty fair to say it’s not going to be that design,” he said.
Hanafin and other experts said all three of the buildings are likely to be eyed by schools and universities. Sidwell Friends is located across the street from 3900 Wisconsin and announced last month that it was buying the Washington Home hospice center next door and would consolidate onto a single campus in D.C.

Universities or colleges may also consider the main property, assessed at $92.1 million, a rare shot at acquiring a leafy D.C. campus.
That may hold true for the other properties as well. The building at 4250 Connecticut Ave., for instance, is adjacent to the University of District of Columbia and the Van Ness-UDC Metro station.
“Washington is one of the only markets in the country where empty building often sell for more than occupied buildings because there is such a dearth of opportunities,” Hanafin said.
The main building’s location sandwiched between sought-after neighborhoods in D.C. and Maryland, also could make it attractive to housing developers. One question for potential buyers is whether there is a creative way to turn the building’s 228,000-square-feet of office space into the kind of high-end housing capable of attracting top prices.
Bill Prutting, senior managing director at the real estate adviser JLL, was skeptical that most prospective buyers would consider re-using the building, in part because its depth didn’t lend itself well to being re-configured into apartments or condominiums (which require windows). There are 280 parking spaces.
“You certainly could put condominiums in that building,” Prutting said. “I just don’t think it lends itself very well to that kind of conversion.”
